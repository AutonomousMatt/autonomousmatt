Kubrick’s Napoleon (1969) vs. Bondarchuk’s Waterloo (1970)


In late 1969, Stanley Kubrick was busy. His career-defining 2001: A Space Odyssey had been an enormous directorial and technical success, he was in the middle of editing the dystopian A Clockwork Orange, and beginning to circle what he thought would be his next grand project, a definitive biographic story of Napoleon. Like all Kubrick projects, especially those following 2001: A Space Odyssey, the process for developing the script, and the sheer effort which went into the production was total. For years, Kubrick had planned to create a biographical film of Napoleon’s life, and had engaged hundreds of production staff in gathering as much information as possible about the era. From costumes, interiors, historical records, surviving written evidence, academic historiography, everything was completely exhaustive, and all of it would go into the creation of what Kubrick believed would be one of the greatest historical films ever made. Weighing in at over 830 pages of production notes, pre-production stills, location scouting, script drafts, correspondence and reference material, all of Kubrick’s work has recently been gathered together into a single volume.


It’s a fascinating artifact of a movie which was never made, and reveals not only the pressures of budget and the wrestling with studio executives, but Kubrick’s seemingly endless curiosity for accuracy in historical detail. From what Napoleon ate every day (and how), to the specific, daily documented movements of those around him and more broadly elsewhere in early nineteenth-century Europe. The gathering of material is immense, with tens of thousands of images, written documents and scholarly perspectives. In immersing himself completely in the material, Kubrick would be able to create the definitive document of one of history’s most fascinating and flawed leaders.


In gathering all of this documentation, he created a highly detailed card catalog to make sense of the themes and categories of activity throughout Napoleon’s life, and planned to put these to work on location in Romania, where most of the movie was planned to be shot (an unusual departure for Kubrick given his preference for shooting near his ex-pat home in Borehamwood, England), and where he had engaged the support of the Romanian army. In total he had commitment for over 40,000 soldiers and over 10,000 cavalrymen, all of whom would wear paper costumes to reduce the cost of needing to make the uniforms from real material. This is before any digitally-generated capability, so any grand shots of armies on the move, large-scale battles, or crowds welcoming Napoleon home would need to be shot live. Nowadays we take such shots for granted, even though we know they couldn’t possibly be real, but in the early 1970s everything needed to be filmed as it happened in the real world, which meant real humans being directed.


Kubrick’s non-committal in his production notes as to casting, but there’s some brief conversation around the casting of David (Barbarella, Blow-Up, Alfred the Great) Hemmings in the title role, who’d recently spent time filming the semi-related Charge of the Light Brigade and had some experience in the depiction of flawed military leaders. Jack Nicholson seemed to be a front runner by the time production was abandoned. Audrey Hepburn had been approached for the role of Napoleon’s wife Josephine, but had politely said no.




Spending time with the production materials is a real treat, and one where you feel Kubrick’s hand in every location scout’s found image, every costume test, and every piece of written correspondence. Everything already feels like a completely realized Kubrick movie. The location stills have an attention to detail to them that’s so cold it’s cool. The endless costume tests, many of which are taken from varying distances to understand how much detail would be visible on screen and essentially how much they could reasonably get away with for the costume budget, are incredible in their breadth and scope, taking in different armies, nationalities, regiments, ethnicities, genders and occupations. And like most Kubrick projects, the result is completely immersive, consuming the viewer in the material, and drawing them in with such incredible detail and nuance, and in this case historical accuracy, as to be so overwhelming we’ve no choice but to take it as truth. At this point the movie stops being a movie, and the story truly becomes magic.


Kubrick’s script itself is fascinating. Essentially a singular chronological narrative spanning Napoleon’s childhood in Corsica to his death in exile on St. Helena. It takes in his early military training, his rise in influence during the French Revolution, through the carnage of Austerlitz, Trafalgar and the disastrous retreat from Moscow. There’s attention given to his escape from Elba, Josephine’s infidelity, and of course, his final defeat and capture by the Allied British and Prussian armies at Waterloo in 1815. It’s expansive in scope, and pulls in many of the details we see getting clarified in Kubrick’s notes elsewhere to distinguished historians he’d engaged as consultants. Many of the script details, especially the use of narration as a guiding force throughout the film, would later resurface in Kubrick’s 1975 Barry Lyndon, which was able to lean on much of the abandoned material Kubrick had assembled, with particular reference to the military engagements which bring Ryan O’Neal’s Redmond Barry to prominence early in the film.


But by 1970 production concerns were escalating, and it was clear that filming on location at such enormous scale was going to be cost-prohibitive. Coupled with the commercial failure of Sergei Bondarchuk’s Waterloo the same year, which Kubrick had called ‘a silly film’ and was much smaller in historical scope but enormous in its use of 17,000 Soviet Army extras, filmed in Ukraine and famous for its incredibly lavish battle scenes. Kubrick ultimately abandoned the Napoleon project in favor of an smaller but no less ambitious adaptation of William Makepeace Thackeray’s The Luck of Barry Lyndon, which bridged the gap in Kubrick’s movies between the dystopian horror of A Clockwork Orange and the psychological horror of The Shining. Over time, there have been several attempts to rehabilitate Kubrick’s script, most notably by Steven Spielberg in 2013 for HBO, but none of them have so far come to anything, and of course, there are some enormous cinematic boots to fill in doing so. Kubrick’s Napoleon continues to fascinate as one of the most incredible movies never made, but the archeology and artifacts left behind, surgically documented and catalogued, give us an amazing window into what could have, would have, should have been.




If Kubrick’s Napoleon promised to be the definitive historical document of the French Emperor’s life, then Bondarchuk’s Waterloo is the memory of the end of that story delivered with extravagant pomp and excess, committing to film some of the most incredibly complex and astonishing scenes in service of the memory, rather than accuracy, of the events of Sunday, June 18, 1815. The main events of the film concern the tactical and often bloody maneuvering between the British and the French during the battle, preceded by the briefest of historical scene-setting introductions to both political climates in the early nineteenth century. Strangely out of place in particular is a cameo from Orson Welles as Louis XVIII of France, who in many ways played himself as the tired, overweight, last gasp of an era long since condemned to history.




But to be clear, Bondarchuk’s Waterloo is epic. Rod Steiger is incredible as the tortured, increasingly desperate Napoleon, a proud man of the people consumed by his own greatness, antithetical to the upper class indifference of Christopher Plummer’s Duke of Wellington, who cares little for the expendability of his own men, and treats the carnage as no more than the pursuit of a fox during an aristocratic hunt. We hear the inner monologues of both leaders frequently throughout the movie, revealing their inner thoughts and fears, as well as their next moves. We as the audience are privvy to the anxiety neither of them can show their armies. Once the scale of both operations have been established, an opening cannon is fired, and the battle begins. Wellington’s men synchronize their ornate pocket watches, and the moving of chess pieces among the Belgian fields of Waterloo opens. Infantry on both sides march to the beat of adolescent drummers. Cavalry anxiously await instructions. Cannons test each other for weakness.






True to historical accuracy, most of the fighting takes place around the farmhouses of Hougoumont and La Haye Sainte, but we are witness to the switching back and forth between Wellington and Napoleon’s perspectives as events unfold, as both sides eagerly await the arrival of reinforcements. Napoleon in the form of Marshal Grouchy’s army, a third of the entire French military, who has been pursuing the Prussians under General Blücher, for whom Wellington waits and buys as much time as he can. Heroism is graphically depicted on both sides, with both French and British fighting to a bitter, bloody end where the pyrrhic winner is going to be the one who dies the least. Regiments are shredded with cannon fire, and cavalry cut down anything in their path. In one of the most memorable scenes, there is a reenactment of the infamously disastrous cavalry charge of the British Scots Greys regiment. As one of Napoleon’s generals, Marshal Soult calls them ‘they are the noblest cavalry in Europe, and the worst led.’ As the charge gathers pace, there’s an incredible set of slow-motion shots of the front of the cavalry charge, with direct reference to Elizabeth Thompson’s 1881 painting ‘Scotland Forever!’, one of the most iconic and memorable images of the entire battle. As we exit the dream sequence, the cavalry charge head-first into the French cannons, are cut down, and while attempting to flee, their aristocratic general is lanced to death and ends face down in the mud.




As the film crescendos, so does the music, but also the scale of the spectacle. The French attempt a desperate cavalry charge in efforts to finally break the British squares, but are deceived by thousands of soldiers hiding behind a hill in the tall grass, just as the Prussians arrive to finish everything and end Napoleon’s dreams of empire. In a brave but ultimately fatal attempt at ending the battle, the British offer surrender to the exhausted remaining French soldiers, who refuse in a way only they can. The British cannons line up, and in one giant burst of fire, the remaining French soldiers are no more.




There’s a tremendous amount of historical creative license taken within Waterloo. Some characters are aggregates, pieced together from different dignitaries that may or may not have even been there. The topography of the battlefield was almost certainly not the one depicted in the rolling hills and fields of Ukraine where the movie was filmed, despite Soviet attempts in pre-production to flatten them. And the field itself was incredibly wet and muddy, which would have dramatically hampered fast-paced events such as cavalry charges or the swift wheeling to-and-fro of the respective artillery. But if that’s the point in Kubrick’s Napoleon, to suspend our disbelief to such an incredibly accurate extent as to place us exactly in that precise time and space, Bondarchuk’s battle gives us an equally powerful simulacrum of the day’s events. A strong enough feeling of the horror of battle, and the thoughts and feelings of its main protagonists. It might well be the fast food to Kubrick’s prime rib, but it’s no less enjoyable, and certainly no less of a technical achievement.




I love Barry Lyndon, but feel Napoleon would have been even better. Increasingly separated from both the studio system and the concerns of the commercial outcomes of his work, Kubrick was entering a period of almost complete directorial autonomy, something he used to tremendous effect with the (only) four movies he’d create after 1971’s A Clockwork Orange. With near-limitless budgets, and broad latitude to create the stories he wanted to tell, such creative freedom also sadly feels like a relic of the past. We can create visually similar special effects to the ones captured in Waterloo, or aspired to in Napoleon, but we know they’re not real, and so we already miss something. But it also feels as though such grand cinematic storytellers are also near extinction. Spielberg, Scorsese and Lynch, Tarantino, Herzog or Moviegoer favorite Wes Anderson. None of them have the enormous strength of curiosity, drive, and sheer will to dare to approach a subject like Kubrick. And being able to spend time with his production archives, aside from being an enormous treat, gives us a starkly clear reason why that’s the case.

key_insight: Hitchcock’s *Rope* subverts the murder mystery by revealing everything at the start, shifting tension from whodunit to how the facade cracks—and how time, space, and guilt unravel together.
---


If it’s one thing which defines many of the films I’ve seen recently, it’s their buttock-numbing length. Often running well beyond three hours, it feels like so many of the films I’ve seen could easily have been either half the running time, or split into a mini-series and simply sent to a streaming product instead of the ordeal of the theater.


Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, the enthusiastic blockbuster hype for which eludes me, could have been cut in half and still told essentially the same story. I get it. Gifted womanizing physicist with left-leaning politics gets drawn into the ethical dilemma motivated by using his talents to end a war but at enormous human cost. The bomb test sequence is certainly technically impressive, but the tedious remainder of the more than three hours before the credits roll is the dull interrogation of boardroom politics. This pattern of modern films getting longer and longer has made me yearn for simpler times where the movies were short, but consciously elastic with time and always left us wanting more.


And when I think of these films which deliberately bend time, I think of old suspenseful thrillers. And when I think of those, there’s really only one place to go, Alfred Hitchcock. His greatest hits all play with time. The chilling horror of Psycho, especially when the soon-to-be-dead-in-the-shower protagonist is driving away from the scene of the crime, seemingly without incident, but all the time our minds feel her guilt and suspicion as she obsessively checks the rear mirror. The voyeuristic apartment surveillance of Rear Window, the premise for which is really just a curious convalescent neighbor seeing what’s going on across the street. The I’m-never-going-outside-again terror of The Birds, and the eerie elasticity of driving away from an ominous flock of ravens sitting on the telephone wires as the credits roll. But the most impressive of all Hitchcock’s time-bending stories is the barely eighty-minute-long Rope from 1948.


Shot and edited into a simulation of real-time, the entire story unfolds much like the original 1929 Patrick Hamilton stage play it draws upon (and its real-life inspiration in the 1924 kidnap and murder of Bobby Franks by Leopold and Loeb), where there is a primary point of view for us as observers, a single location, and a carousel of characters which enter stage left and right.


The premise is a simple one, but inverts all of the common tropes of the murder mystery. It opens with the murder itself, where two young intellectual Manhattan graduates, Brandon and Phillip, are throttling their former classmate David to death with a rope bound tight across his neck. We later learn they are doing do as an intellectual exercise in proving to themselves that such is their power of their position in life, they are able to commit the perfect murder and get away with it. But we as the audience are already in on it all. We know the murderers. We know the murder weapon. And we know the motive. The entire length of the movie subsequently unfolds with the suspense of how they’ll be found out.


Brandon and Phillip hide the body in a large wooden chest in their living room prior to their hosting of a dinner party for a number of close friends, and set some of the food on the chest itself to deliciously sinister effect. Hitchcock plays back and forth with a number of near misses of discovery as the guests circle the chest’s buffet, unaware of what’s inside as they ask when David is going to arrive and how uncharacteristic it is for him to be so tardy. The rope itself plays its part in binding together some books which Brandon loans to one of the guests, sending the murder weapon away from the scene in someone else’s hands. But all is not well between Brandon and Phillip. Risqué for 1948’s mainstream sensibilities, the implied romantic connection between the two is starting to come apart as the tension builds, with Brandon’s dominance over Phillip becoming more and more agitated as the dinner (and their deception) unfolds. 


Enter Rupert, wonderfully played by James Stewart, who’d go on to be a Hitchcock-defining staple in his later films Vertigo, The Man Who Knew Too Much, and Rear Window. A former school housemaster of Brandon and Phillip’s, Rupert engages them in a philosophical discussion about societal hierarchy and the superiority of the privileged, and for whom Brandon delights in hinting at the wonderful work of art he and Phillip have been working on recently. We as the audience squirm as the deception unravels and Rupert’s suspicions eventually grow into finding out what’s been going on, and the real reason why David is never going to arrive. The body in the chest is discovered, and a hurried confrontation concludes with the police on their way as Brandon sits quietly and drinks, his flawed masterpiece complete.


Highly innovative for its time, and still a wonderfully mischievous piece of film-making, Rope unravels in real-time, and presents itself as one continuous shot. Modern audiences will notice where the technical cuts are as shots close on the actors’ backs and then zoom out again, or where empty shots of hallways disguise the technical necessities of changing the reel, but the incredible thing here is that there’s so much that happens in the overall eighty minutes. The dinner party itself only lasts for about twenty minutes, but it feels as if it’s much longer, Hitchcock contracting and expanding time through the lens of suspense.


But it’s not the suspense of us as the audience finding out. It’s the suspense of the characters. We already know everything, and as the characters circle the chest, or playfully twirl the rope in their hands as they chat, we know that it is only a matter of time before they also find out. We are just waiting for Brandon and Phillip to slip up, as they inevitably do. But when and how that happens is continuously toyed with by Hitchcock, who delights at giving us just enough insight to keep us watching through our fingers.


At the time, Rope opened to mixed reviews, with The New York Times unimpressed about Hitchcock’s treatment of time, describing the "novelty of the picture is not in the drama itself, it being a plainly deliberate and rather thin exercise in suspense, but merely in the method which Mr. Hitchcock has used to stretch the intended tension for the length of the little stunt" for a "story of meager range". Similarly Time wrote that “Much of the play's deadly excitement dwelt in [the] juxtaposition of callow brilliance and lavender dandyism with moral idiocy and brutal horror. Much of its intensity came from the shocking change in the teacher, once he learned what was going on. In the movie, the boys and their teacher are shrewdly plausible but much more conventional types. Even so, the basic idea is so good and, in its diluted way, Rope is so well done that it makes a rattling good melodrama”. Hitchcock himself described Rope as an experiment which didn’t work out, and would keep it out of distribution for decades. How lucky are we to still be able to see it today.


Compared to the fatigue of our modern blockbusters, Rope does so much more in about a third of the time. It doesn’t weld us to our seat, it keeps us on the edge of it. It uses the claustrophobia of suspense and the immediate reveal of the tropes of the traditional murder mystery to stretch and fold time into what feels like real-time, but isn’t. We know everything and still scream at the screen that the body has been there the whole time. We know the murderers aren’t going to get away with anything. And we know the star of the film is going to be the one to unravel it all. And yet, like everything that’s great about the movies we love, we are compelled to keep watching.

summary: A deeply personal reflection on Terry Gilliam's cinematic legacy, childhood memories, and the transformative power of storytelling through film.
key_insight: Gilliam’s surreal, chaotic visual storytelling—rooted in his Monty Python origins—transcends generational boundaries by evoking wonder, nostalgia, and imagination.
---




I was one of those kids at school who needed the crayons to be taken away from them. My mom tells the story of my first day of school, and how I cried at the end of the day when I wasn’t able to bring the picture I’d drawn home with me. I was the arty kid in high school, and the even artier kid by the time I got to enrolling into a Fine Art degree in college. For as long as I can remember, I’ve always made things.


But when I think about the kinds of things which have influenced me along the way, one of the earliest memories I have is of gloomy Sunday afternoons growing up in the bleak seventies of rural England, and watching Monty Python’s Flying Circus with my Dad.


I remember all the classic sketches of course. The Dead Parrot. The Lumberjack. The Spanish Inquisition. The Ministry of Silly Walks and my favorite, The Argument Clinic. My Dad would roar with laughter at the deeply English silliness of it all, contagious to such an extent where even my teenage daughter today has the same dark sense of humor. I loved the absurdly elaborate language and the lampooning of institutions of government and faith.


But what I loved most about it was the visual language which wrapped around all the sketches. The ornate Victorian typography and the collaged society gentlemen whose teeth doubled as music hall organs and whose feet would descend and crush all beneath them. For me, the animations were always the best part of the show, and by the time the Pythons had graduated to the movies, there was even more of it.


It was the Python who had the least screen time that I fell in love with. Terry Gilliam’s wonderfully surreal animations were always the standout parts of both the show itself and their later movies. So when he began to direct full-length live action movies, bringing the chaos of what had always been in his head to the screen, it was, and still is, a complete treat. Gilliam’s work was absolutely instrumental in shaping the kind of work I’ve loved, and still love to do.


It was deeply, awkwardly British, but held an outsider’s absurdly surreal perspective on all the ridiculousness and pomp of empire. And most importantly, it lacked any real polish. The animation was often as crude as the cutouts themselves, with the tops of heads flipping open, hands grasping at the loosest of female clothing, and the ever-present cannons waiting to dispense with our protagonists.


My Dad and I had watched Monty Python and The Holy Grail together, but it wasn’t until Gilliam’s 1981 Time Bandits that I really fell in love with the animations that had now become real life worlds. I must have worn out the VHS tape we had from when it aired on television, and I only recently re‑watched it for the first time in probably over thirty years. It’s still wonderful, and it made me laugh all over again in all the same places. The special effects don’t hold up, but they don’t need to.


The strength of the story, and the wonderful performances from the cast, especially the bandits themselves, more than hold everything together. It brought me back to my childhood, and watching the film over and over again, and always finding something new.


There’s some highly memorable set pieces within it, my (and probably everyone’s) favorite being when the ship the bandits find themselves on ends up being a giant’s hat as he walks out of the ocean with the ship still rattling around strapped to his head. And it’s these images which stay with you in Gilliam’s films. The absurdly wonderful images of a fantasy world rendered completely real, but still retaining all the spectacle of a story that’s always that little bit too tall of a tale.


And of course, when it comes to tall tales, no‑one told them bigger than Baron Munchausen. By the late eighties Gilliam’s films had just gotten exponentially more complicated each time, but 1988’s The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, his sequel to Brazil, is probably the most challenging of them all, and Gilliam, often beset by production difficulties, had earned a reputation as a studio warmonger when it came to getting his films made.


But production difficulties only matter to those that care, and the results of what ends up in the movie speak for themselves. And Baron Munchausen speaks volumes.


When I write these reviews, I often include a recap of the plot, but doing that here would never do justice to the film, or to Gilliam’s story. It is so wonderful, so fantastic, so full of buckle and swash that you should just watch it for yourself. And if you’re one of those who loved it the first time around, treat yourself to watching it again and you won’t be disappointed. It has all the absurdity of the first time you saw it.


The incredible turns by the ensemble cast, especially (the uncredited) King of the Moon by Robin Williams, Gilliam’s Python pal Eric Idle as the speedster Berthold, Oliver Reed as a deranged god of fire Vulcan, and of course, the wonderful John Neville as Munchausen himself, in all his glorious infallibility. The score swells and soars as Munchausen’s odyssey takes him across space and time in service of saving the day.


Whenever I watch The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, or Time Bandits, I’m completely transported back to watching Python with my Dad on a gloomy Sunday afternoon in front of the fireplace as a kid. And just smiling through the whole thing. Except this time now I’m the Dad, passing it on to my daughter. And those really are the best moments in the movies, and in all stories. The ones which not only take you back, but propel you forward. The ones you can pass on to those who’ll follow you.

The Conscious Cruelty of I, Daniel Blake


Turning the camera on an uncomfortable truth doesn’t just help us see something differently, it helps us to see ourselves differently. It asks us to confront the corners of ourselves we might better leave in the dark. And it often shines a light on the very worst of us. Since the 1960s, British director Ken Loach has consistently illuminated the forgotten, the marginalized, and those of us left behind. He’s drawn attention to homelessness, to hardship, and especially to the indifference of the state in abandoning its responsibilities toward the most vulnerable amongst us. His 2016 film I, Daniel Blake, focuses on the latter, where tensions are boiling as austerity measures take hold in Brexit Britain.


When confronted about his work, Loach has consistently referred to the extreme measures forgotten individuals resort to in the face of governmental indifference as ‘conscious cruelty’. The imposition of maddening bureaucracy, and the deliberate unwillingness of the elected to help the desperate. Food banks are giving out millions of packages each year, and the elderly in particular left to exist on less and less. Combine this with the economic self-inflicted isolationist head wound of Brexit, and it coalesces into a toxic cocktail of populist extremism, criminality and violence.




Most of Loach’s films are infused with a deep, aching melancholy. But in that sadness is truth. The truth not just about how things are, but how they feel. What it feels like to lose a loved one. What it feels like to be so desperate that your only option is to rely on the charity of others. Or what it feels like to have to resort to the basest of behaviors to simply put food on the table for your family. Like his peer Mike Leigh, Loach’s films are often characterized as bleak, but in the bleakness is hope, and very often a deep kindness. I, Daniel Blake is such a story about the tender kindness of strangers in the face of an uncaring state.




The titular protagonist, wonderfully played by Dave Johns, is a recent heart attack survivor who, nearing the end of his working life, is also a recent widower. Denied the benefits of unemployment and support allowance despite being declared unfit to work by his doctor, he finds himself inside an endless spiral of paperwork and frustration, lost in the digital divide. At the local employment office, he befriends Katie, played with deep desperation by the incredible Hayley Squires, a single mother of two who has recently arrived in Newcastle from London. She’s been on the waiting list for a home for years, but when she finally gets one, it’s hundreds of miles away from her family. In their desperation they find each other. He helps her at home and with the kids. She helps keep him company in his loneliness. She’s doing everything she can to hold things together. But it’s a fragile balance between dwindling funds and increasing bills. Daniel’s in the same place, but in their lives they see each other. There’s no hint of romantic interest, just two desperate people helping each other. Their relationship is pure, and good.




But as Katie gets increasingly frustrated by her isolated predicament, she turns to food banks for meals, and prostitution for income. Unable to get any other job, she echoes Daniel’s futile search for work, despite his poor health. There are simply too few jobs for too many people. Daniel discovers Katie’s work, and confronts her, but she refuses to let him intervene. The film concludes with Daniel’s benefits appeal finally coming through, but as he waits to be interviewed, a case he seems certain to win, he suffers a fatal heart attack, and dies in the bathroom of the employment office. Katie is destroyed, and offers what little words of kindness remain by way of eulogy at his pauper’s funeral. As with most Loach films, there is rarely a happy ending. No neat bow with which to conclude the story. And just like life, no resolution of the pain felt by the characters. In that frustration, there is deep, aching truth. This is how it really is for millions of people. And while we as viewers get to be tourists in this world for a couple of hours, as the credits roll it leaves us uncomfortable knowing we still live in a world where these injustices happen and we still do nothing.




I, Daniel Blake didn’t just make me sad, it made me angry. It made me furious that this still happens in modern Britain. It made me furious how an elected government could just abandon large parts of the population and rely on the bureaucratic apathy of people just giving up in order to help the economy. It made me furious that people were being reduced to numbers on spreadsheets.


But it also made me hungry. Hungry for change. Hungry to do something. And it’s this feeling of motivation that Loach has always excelled at. In shining a light on the uncomfortable truth about ourselves, we are offered a choice. Do something. Or do nothing. What I saw in I, Daniel Blake wasn’t right. And I felt part of the problem in being complicit in my indifference. But if I’m part of the problem, I’m also part of the solution. That is my choice too. At the very least I can donate. I can offer my time. I can listen. And I can get educated. I can see those affected. And if I can do these things, I can perhaps get a little closer to what those in need often want most… kindness.

Title: More War Than Peace
Author: Matthew Shadbolt
Date: Nov 30
Summary: A sweeping tribute to Sergei Bondarchuk’s four-part Soviet epic 'War and Peace', exploring its immense historical ambition, staggering practical scale, and lasting cinematic significance.
Key Insight: Bondarchuk’s adaptation of War and Peace is not just a cinematic masterpiece of its era, but a cultural artifact exemplifying what is now a lost mode of epic filmmaking—one rooted in realism, manpower, and Soviet cultural assertion rather than digital manipulation.

Sergei Bondarchuk’s 4 War & Peace Films (1966-67)


When older generations say that they don’t make movies like they used to, they’re talking about Sergei Bondarchuk’s War and Peace films, released between 1966 and 1967. An absolutely breathtaking series of four individual movies spread out over seven hours, recounting in elaborate, authentic and highly orchestrated detail, Tolstoy’s epic tale of Russian aristocratic and military perspective during the Napoleonic invasion of the early nineteenth century. But epic doesn’t even come close to describing Bondarchuk’s films, which are enormous in scale, extraordinary in ambition, and astounding in depth. In short, they are a phenomenal example of precisely what the movies are all about, but also a sad archeological artifact of a craft lost to the digital frontier.


I’ve never read Tolstoy’s War and Peace, and if I’m honest, as I think many of us are too, was always intimidated by taking on a novel of such immense size. Often cited as one of the longest ever works of fiction (although there’s some historical dispute as to just how fictional the story actually is, mainly from Tolstoy himself), it tends to be a story a modern audience knows about because of its size, rather than actually being familiar with its substance. And like many nineteenth century novels, especially those of Austen, Bronte, Hardy and Thackeray, has been creatively adapted numerous times on television and in the movies, with varying degrees of license and success. Most notably the abomination of an adaptation from Hollywood in 1956, with a horribly miscast Henry Fonda as the lead protagonist Pierre, who can’t ever seem to shake off the cowboy drawl even in Napoleonic-era Russia, and Audrey Hepburn doing her utmost to hold things together as the ill-fated Natasha.


The origins of the production of the movies themselves are as fascinating as Tolstoy’s novel, and in many ways Bondarchuk’s series of films are the weaponized works of Soviet cultural reappropriation, and are a direct response to the west in showing the world just how powerful Russian film makers can be, with much of the unprecedented level of funding for the series coming directly from the state socialist government. Following the Hollywood production in 1956, there was another American-Italian produced version which was released in the Soviet Union to positive reception, but planted the seed of Russian reclamation of Tolstoy’s story to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the 1812 invasion, as well as use it as an opportunity to cement Soviet cultural and creative superiority in a time of an increasingly colder war with the west under Khruschchev. With strong governmental motivation to back such a project, and the seemingly inexhaustible resources which that would bring, Sergei Bondarchuk was brought on as director, the project put into development, and by early 1962 a party-approved script for initially three, and later four movies, was ready. Vyacheslav Tikhonov was cast as the lead in the first film, the eponymous Prince Andrei Bolkonsky, at the suggestion of a government official. In addition to directing, Bondarchuk himself would play the overall novel’s main protagonist Pierre Bezukhov, and the 19 year old Ludmila Savelyeva, who could easily pass as Hepburn’s Russian double, was cast as Natasha Rostova, whose story of love lost and found fills out most of the activity between the main battle scenes and set military pieces.


The first movie, already weighing in at over two hours, Andrei Bolkonsky, sets the cultural and military tone for the subsequent films, and introduces us to the interpersonal web of emotional conflicts present within a small but tight group within the Russian aristocracy of the early nineteenth century. The palatial events are grand, the meals even grander, and the set design is breathtaking. The eponymous Andrei’s dispatched to fight the French and takes part in the battles of Schöngrabern and Austerlitz. He’s badly wounded, and mistaken for dead, foreshadowing an actual death towards the end of the series itself after lingering for most of what happens over the next few years. Pierre gets married, but his marriage falls apart after his wife is found to have been unfaithful. But it’s the enormous set pieces of both battles which are the main attraction. The sheer scale of the tens of thousands of soldiers and cavalry lent by the Soviet government to the production creates an authenticity unmatched ever since. When we see enormous numbers of troops on the move, far in the distance, they are real. And it’s these vast shots across the battlefields, drenched in blood, smoke and the death of thousands, which truly brings the era to life with what we conclude to be incredible historical accuracy. The camera follows the twists and turns of the day’s events, especially at Austerlitz, and we’re treated to the inner monologues of both generals, as Bondarchuk would later double down on with 1970’s Waterloo. The camera follows the cannon shells from firing to impact, gives us close-ups of the horror of mass death, and truly pulls us into that world with visceral reality. And while as the audience we side with the Russians against the invading French, there is heroism and sacrifice on both sides. The movie ends in bleak disarray, with the French threatening to edge closer to Moscow, and Pierre, Andrei and Natasha’s lives in increasing jeopardy.


If Andrei Bolkonsky is more War than Peace, then the second installment, Natasha Rostova is still war, but of a very different kind. It opens on one of the most lavish balls ever captured on film, where Andrei meets and falls in love with a debutante Natasha. After a brief courtship, they decide to marry but are forced to wait a year by Andrei’s father. Andrei travels overseas, but both find the situation unbearable, especially Natasha, who in a moment of weakness meets the equally handsome Anatole (who Pierre’s wife had slept with, oh the intrigue!), where she renounces Andrei and decides to elope. Discovering what’s been going on while he’s been away, Andrei calls it all off, at which point Natasha suffers a nervous breakdown. With Anatole having brought chaos to both their lives, Pierre comforts Natasha and declares that he loves her. So Natasha Rostova is still war, but an emotional one between family, obligation, societal expectation and the undeclared affection for the one you can’t have. It’s much shorter than the first installment, but true to many Soviet-era cinema, the shots linger uncomfortably long, the glances last an eternity, and even short walks from one side of a room to another seem to really take their time, especially for modern audiences. But that’s what makes them all the more authentic. You can feel the characters wrestling with their moral dilemmas. You can hear their hearts break. And you can (as I did) very easily join them in their tears at loves lost.


Part three, The Year 1812, is the shortest, but easily most intense and incredibly produced of them all. Only 84 minutes long, and over an hour shorter than Andrei Bolkonsky, it centers around Napoleon’s invasion of Russia, and the epic confrontation with the Russian army at the Battle of Borodino, where the Russian army is forced to retreat, leaving the prize of Moscow open for the French to take. Pierre, dressed in his gentleman’s finest, assists a brave artillery battery, where Andrei, seemingly a magnet for shells, is severely injured again. Epic doesn’t even begin to describe what Bondarchuk commits to his 70mm widescreen celluloid. The battle rages far off into the distance, with hundreds of thousands of extras, thousands of horses, and hundreds of cannons all embroiled in the fog of war. The cinematography is amazing, as of course is the phenomenal task of the authentic costume design at such scale.


Knowing that the films were shot in 1966, before any material digital technology existed, and using on the most primitive of editing techniques to combine shots together for more narrative context than anything else, brings an extraordinary authenticity to everything, and the awe we feel at the sheer effort of it all is staggering. Co-ordinating such scenes, which were often shot many times over, across hundreds of thousands of moving pieces, is an incredible achievement, one which earned the series both a Golden Globe and an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1969, the first Soviet picture ever to do so. At the time it was also the longest film ever to receive any Academy Award. Such small accolades seem immaterial to the work itself.


The series concludes with Pierre Bezukhov, which focuses on the French sacking of a deserted Moscow, and the catastrophic French retreat during the winter of 1812/3, which would decimate the French military and ultimately lead to their defeat at Waterloo three years later. Aside from the stunning cinematography of an entire city burning as tens of thousands of its residents flee, we are treated to one last battle at Krasnoi, where the French are finally defeated by the Russians. Through it all, Natasha, now a much more mature and worldly refugee, reconciles with the crippled Andrei, who becomes delirious on his deathbed and forgives her infidelity. There are some wonderful dream sequences, which were closely inspired by the several heart attacks Bondarchuk himself suffered during the production. The bare white walls of the room Andrei finds himself in at the point of death was directly inspired by his own experience of being clinically dead for several minutes and experiencing the common ‘white light’ often reported in such circumstances. Pierre, having survived a horrific sequence of French butchery at the hands of a firing squad, also reunites with Natasha, and we close with the hopeful scenes of a new Moscow being rebuilt.


To binge watch the film in its entirety will take you close to eight hours with no bathroom breaks. But when you get to the end, and as the wonderful Russian Cyrillic script scrolls through the briefest of credits, the sense that you’ve seen a movie like no other is palpable. And to modern audiences, a movie we’re unlikely ever to see again. The enormous cost of production and sheer manpower to even put these images on camera in the real world is phenomenal, but an art I think sadly lost to the algorithmic compositions of the digital editing suite. There simply was no ‘we’ll fix it in post’ for Bondarchuk. No green screens, no special effects, no industrial light and magic to lean on. Just one of the world’s most incredible and epic stories, a fearless director, the overwhelming, bottomless faith and resources which come with cultural hegemony, and the grit, determination and absolute perseverance to do justice to a Soviet great.


Bondarchuk would go on to direct 1970’s Waterloo, and bring a close to Napoleon’s reign in the muddy, bloody fields of Belgium, and as epic as Waterloo is, it’s not anywhere near the scale and effort of War and Peace. Waterloo was more broadly distributed in the West, with War and Peace languishing as a ‘foreign film’ for decades, and commercially challenging given its length, content and reliance upon subtitles. When watching Waterloo, all the DNA from War and Peace is there. Many of the same shots, camera angles and editing techniques are used. But War and Peace is by far the superior experience, and in an era where binging is in vogue, you can do no better than spending a day in the emotional chaos and confusion of Tolstoy’s Russia.


War and Peace is currently streaming on The Criterion Channel.

The Conscious Cruelty of I, Daniel Blake


Turning the camera on an uncomfortable truth doesn’t just help us see something differently, it helps us to see ourselves differently. It asks us to confront the corners of ourselves we might better leave in the dark. And it often shines a light on the very worst of us. Since the 1960s, British director Ken Loach has consistently illuminated the forgotten, the marginalized, and those of us left behind. He’s drawn attention to homelessness, to hardship, and especially to the indifference of the state in abandoning its responsibilities toward the most vulnerable amongst us. His 2016 film I, Daniel Blake, focuses on the latter, where tensions are boiling as austerity measures take hold in Brexit Britain.


When confronted about his work, Loach has consistently referred to the extreme measures forgotten individuals resort to in the face of governmental indifference as ‘conscious cruelty’. The imposition of maddening bureaucracy, and the deliberate unwillingness of the elected to help the desperate. Food banks are giving out millions of packages each year, and the elderly in particular left to exist on less and less. Combine this with the economic self-inflicted isolationist head wound of Brexit, and it coalesces into a toxic cocktail of populist extremism, criminality and violence.




Most of Loach’s films are infused with a deep, aching melancholy. But in that sadness is truth. The truth not just about how things are, but how they feel. What it feels like to lose a loved one. What it feels like to be so desperate that your only option is to rely on the charity of others. Or what it feels like to have to resort to the basest of behaviors to simply put food on the table for your family. Like his peer Mike Leigh, Loach’s films are often characterized as bleak, but in the bleakness is hope, and very often a deep kindness. I, Daniel Blake is such a story about the tender kindness of strangers in the face of an uncaring state.




The titular protagonist, wonderfully played by Dave Johns, is a recent heart attack survivor who, nearing the end of his working life, is also a recent widower. Denied the benefits of unemployment and support allowance despite being declared unfit to work by his doctor, he finds himself inside an endless spiral of paperwork and frustration, lost in the digital divide. At the local employment office, he befriends Katie, played with deep desperation by the incredible Hayley Squires, a single mother of two who has recently arrived in Newcastle from London. She’s been on the waiting list for a home for years, but when she finally gets one, it’s hundreds of miles away from her family. In their desperation they find each other. He helps her at home and with the kids. She helps keep him company in his loneliness. She’s doing everything she can to hold things together. But it’s a fragile balance between dwindling funds and increasing bills. Daniel’s in the same place, but in their lives they see each other. There’s no hint of romantic interest, just two desperate people helping each other. Their relationship is pure, and good.




But as Katie gets increasingly frustrated by her isolated predicament, she turns to food banks for meals, and prostitution for income. Unable to get any other job, she echoes Daniel’s futile search for work, despite his poor health. There are simply too few jobs for too many people. Daniel discovers Katie’s work, and confronts her, but she refuses to let him intervene. The film concludes with Daniel’s benefits appeal finally coming through, but as he waits to be interviewed, a case he seems certain to win, he suffers a fatal heart attack, and dies in the bathroom of the employment office. Katie is destroyed, and offers what little words of kindness remain by way of eulogy at his pauper’s funeral. As with most Loach films, there is rarely a happy ending. No neat bow with which to conclude the story. And just like life, no resolution of the pain felt by the characters. In that frustration, there is deep, aching truth. This is how it really is for millions of people. And while we as viewers get to be tourists in this world for a couple of hours, as the credits roll it leaves us uncomfortable knowing we still live in a world where these injustices happen and we still do nothing.




I, Daniel Blake didn’t just make me sad, it made me angry. It made me furious that this still happens in modern Britain. It made me furious how an elected government could just abandon large parts of the population and rely on the bureaucratic apathy of people just giving up in order to help the economy. It made me furious that people were being reduced to numbers on spreadsheets.


But it also made me hungry. Hungry for change. Hungry to do something. And it’s this feeling of motivation that Loach has always excelled at. In shining a light on the uncomfortable truth about ourselves, we are offered a choice. Do something. Or do nothing. What I saw in I, Daniel Blake wasn’t right. And I felt part of the problem in being complicit in my indifference. But if I’m part of the problem, I’m also part of the solution. That is my choice too. At the very least I can donate. I can offer my time. I can listen. And I can get educated. I can see those affected. And if I can do these things, I can perhaps get a little closer to what those in need often want most… kindness.

Managing Alone: The Salvation Of Kes


Even though I grew up in England, I never really went anywhere considered the north of the country. I am, I guess, a rural southerner by upbringing, and an urban southerner by education. My parents would take me on the occasional trip to Yorkshire, and I ended up having friends in Liverpool and Manchester, but as the years passed, those friends faded away, and my life settled in the south before eventually moving away to Philadelphia and staying in America for good.


Despite all of this, for as long as I can remember I’ve been fascinated with the north. I grew up in a home that loved The Beatles, and as I turned into a teenager I fell in love with the music of the north too. The Smiths, Joy Division, The Fall, The Stone Roses, and in later years Oasis, and dozens of others whose sound seemed to growl out of the black and white crumbling factories and long forgotten industries in order to reach inside of sensitive art college kids all over the world, take them by the hand and say “I feel it too”. There was something about the grey, depressed, bleakness of it all that, as an outsider, was just so unbelievable in what it was producing. I loved it all then, and I still love it all today. I’m listening to New Order as I write this.


I loved the movies of the north too. And there’s some really great ones. The Damned United, with Michael Sheen in wonderful form as football manager Brian Clough is well worth adding to your queue. Brassed Off with a young Ewan McGregor fresh off the success of Trainspotting. And 1971’s Get Carter, with Michael Caine in intense menacing gangster form. But to find the real movies of the north, you have to go back a bit further. Albert Finney’s incredible 1960 Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, or John Schlesinger’s stunning Billy Liar from 1963 are better, bleaker, and infused with the kind of biting sarcasm that can only be found in the cities of northern England. But of all the films about the north, there is always one which rises above all others. Only one which you can’t forget once you watch it. And only one which consistently gets voted one of the best British films of all time. 


1969’s Kes, directed by Ken Loach, who had cut his teeth with a number of hard hitting social commentaries on television during the sixties, had made the move from small to big screen by the end of the decade, and adapted author Barry Hines’ story A Kestrel for a Knave into a full-length picture. It follows Billy Casper, wonderfully played by the fifteen year old David Bradley, who lives with his broken family in the even more broken northern city of Barnsley. Billy’s a survivor. He’s small and weak, but intensely resourceful. He steals and cheats, gets into fights, and seems to forever find himself bullied and in trouble at school. His life’s prospects are the same as everyone else’s. Leave school and go to work in the local factory. But underneath it all he’s a good kid. His father’s gone, and he’s subject to the violence of his older brother and the indifference of his mother who does little to separate them.




Walking home from school through the nearby fields, Billy finds a bird’s nest, where he eventually befriends a kestrel, whom he names Kes. He learns falconry, steals food, and teaches himself how to get Kes to swoop and circle around him in some of the movie’s most delightful and tender scenes. In all of Billy’s human chaos, he finally finds a friend. These scenes between the kestrel and Billy are contrasted with the abuse and violence he experiences at school. This is most comedically acute during a hysterical football scene where the gym teacher attempts to relive past glories, plays both referee and star player, tackles the kids, and dives for a penalty. The reactions of the boys during the game are all real. When the teacher cheats, Loach leaves the camera running and their complaining is real.


Through Kes, we start to see Billy grow beyond his environment, and the faintest of hope emerges for a way in which Billy might be able to escape the path laid out for him. He is unhappy everywhere, but happy with Kes. He is no longer alone. But it’s a relationship he can’t keep quiet. He shares a demonstration of his skills for one of his more sensitive and understanding teachers, who is greatly impressed, a first for Billy. But when Billy’s abusive brother asks Billy to put a bet on a horse race for him, Billy instead spends the money on food for Kes. When the horse wins and there’s no payout, all hell breaks loose at home, and Kes is killed. Distraught, Billy buries the bird on a nearby hill, and the movie ends.


As bleak as it is, and as unresolved as it leaves us, we still see hope for Billy as the credits roll. He’s found a way out and for the first time felt genuine happiness. Everywhere he’s trapped is just that little bit less oppressive. Kes is a movie which reaches into the hearts of any kid who was picked last in gym class. Any kid who had to endure the bullied abuse of others and the violent indifference of teachers. Any kid who ended up finding something away from it all they genuinely loved. And ultimately, it’s for any kid who managed to escape.




Even though I grew up in rural England, many of the scenes in Kes are deeply familiar. The school scenes of punishment through caning, or the cold bleakness of a muddy football field and a ball that feels as if it’s made of iron when it hits you. The walks through the fields looking for birds’ nests. And those are really the best of moments in the movies. Those moments when the movies hold a mirror up to who we are, and give us a glimpse of who we might become. They take our hand and tell us they feel it too. They give us reason to think we’re not on our own. And most powerfully of all, they do what all great stories achieve. They offer us escape.

summary: A powerful reflection on the political and cinematic significance of "The Long Good Friday," exploring its depiction of London’s criminal underworld amid IRA turmoil.

---


Growing up in England in the seventies, I remember watching the grainy news footage of carnage caused by Irish sectarian violence. I’d later witness it first hand when I moved to London as a student in the nineties and was near enough to hear one of the bomb blasts blow hundreds of windows out of a skyscraper. I still don’t understand many of the complex historical intricacies of the Irish Republican Army’s motivations, but I do know that their domestic terror activities on mainland England hung like an ominous specter over much of the time I was growing up.


”I'm setting up the biggest deal in Europe with the hardest organization since Hitler stuck as swastika on his jockstrap.”


This is the social backdrop for one of the best British movies ever made, The Long Good Friday, which pits the financial motivations of London’s gangsters against the political actions of the IRA in the early 1980s. It would introduce the world to George Harrison’s Handmade Films, which went on to make some of the most wonderful British movies of all time, including Withnail and I, Time Bandits and Monty Python’s The Life of Brian. It also introduced the world to Bob Hoskins, for whom it would launc...


”Well, let's put it this way. Apart from his arsehole being about fifty yards away from his brains, and the choirboys playing hunt the thimble with the rest of him, he ain't too happy.”


The plot is simple, but violent. Hoskins plays gangster Harold Shand, who controls a network of criminality centered in East London, but which reaches as far as New York. He’s surrounded by an inner circle of associates, including Helen Mirren’s Victoria, who plays the role of sophisticated moll to wonderful effect. Derek Thompson, who never did much again in the movies but who’d go on to become a household name every Saturday evening as the star of the BBC’s long running hospital drama Casualty is Shan...


”I'm glad I found out in time just what a partnership with a pair of wankers like you would've been. A sleeping partner's one thing, but you're in a fucking coma! No wonder you got an energy crisis your side of the water!”


British gangster movies weren’t anything new in 1980, but they’d never been made quite like this before, and sparked a wave of realism which would reach its peak with films such as Guy Ritchie’s Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch, both of which owe a great debt to The Long Good Friday. Hoskins is wonderfully sinister as the threatened kingpin, always with the promise of violence bubbling away underneath the surface. British gangster films, especially those set in London, always deliver some...


”It must've been just after you saw him and just before Alan saw him. Otherwise, you'd have noticed, wouldn't you? I mean, a geezer nailed to the floor. A man of your education would definitely have spotted that, wouldn't he?”


There’s also some fantastic set pieces through the film, such as when Shand tells his assembled guests as they cruise down the Thames on his private yacht of his entrepreneurial aspirations towards doing business in Europe, something which reflected a deeply optimistic Thatcherite spirit of the times but would dissolve into the divisive chaos of Brexit many years later. And true to all gangster films, there always has to be a torture scene where the protagonist interrogates his suspects. Here it’s Sha...


”What I'm looking for is someone who can contribute to what England has given to the world: culture, sophistication, genius. A little bit more than a hot dog, know what I mean?”


Both Shand’s criminals and the IRA use violence to achieve their ends, but their ends could not be more different. Where money is everything for Shand’s gangsters, it means nothing to the Irish terrorists. Politics is simply a corruptible opportunity towards economic prosperity for Shand, but for the IRA politics is a struggle towards justice to be served and historic wrongs to be set right. Murder is a common weapon, and the fear and intimidation used by both sides is everywhere. If Hoskins carries th...


”Remember, scare the shit out of them, but don't damage them. I want 'em conscious and talkative. And lads, try and be discreet, eh?”


While The Long Good Friday is absolutely a product of its time, it is at its core, just a great story of deception, greed and violence, with early eighties London itself one of the main characters. In the final shot, Hoskins’ Shand is being driven away to his fate at Irish gunpoint, and the camera lingers on a tight shot of him considering his next move, which we as the audience know will be futile. Led away to die as the cycle of violence continues. But this uncomfortable shot is reflective of the movie...

summary: "A personal and poetic reflection on Derek Jarman’s final film *Blue*, exploring its singular form, emotional resonance, and haunting testament to life with AIDS."

My Heart’s Memory Turns To You: Derek Jarman’s Blue


“Charity has allowed the uncaring to appear to care and is terrible for those dependent on it. It has become big business as the government shirks its responsibilities in these uncaring times.”


More last testament than love letter, Derek Jarman’s 1993 experimental film Blue was as unique and challenging then as it continues to be today. More radio play than movie, it’s 79 minutes of an entirely blue saturated screen, over which two interwoven stories braid together to weave a story of Jarman’s recollected, daydreamed, restless experiences of living with AIDS in 1990s London, and the adventures of blue itself as a color and a character. Punctuated throughout are the ghostly names of Jarman’s former friends and lovers already lost to the disease. 


“I’m walking along the beach in a howling gale. Another year is passing. In the roaring waters I hear the voices of dead friends. Love is life, it lasts forever. My heart’s memory turns to you. David. Howard. Graham. Terry. Paul.”




At the time of making the film, Jarman was losing his sight to the treatment, and only able to see in shades of blue, rendering him partially blind as the medicine, still highly experimental in the early nineties, struggled to ease the suffering of those affected by a condition few understood, and for whom society was still fearful. Jarman documents these complications, both as patient but also documentarian, leaving behind a witnessed record of lived experience that’s as tender as it is heartbreaking. The narrative often slips into sedated, dreamlike, lost modes, where the viewer, consumed by only the voices of the story but immersed in the visual sensation of the blue screen, takes Jarman’s hand and joins him on his journey to who knows where. We hold his hand as he dreams of being an astronaut, and wonders what it’s like to walk across a deep blue sky. But these beautiful moments are always swiftly contrasted with the numbing deterioration of Jarman’s body and eyesight as the side effects of treatment grow ever aggressive. Jarman would die of the disease in early 1994, mere months after the film’s release.


”The worst of the illness is uncertainty. I’ve played this scenario back and forth each hour of the day for the last six years. Blue transcends the solemn geography of human limits.”




When the film premiered in Britain, it aired simultaneously on both television and radio in September 1993, and even then the sense of finality was palpable. Jarman had been a prominent figure in British avant-garde cinema for many years, a popular, outspoken advocate for gay rights, and even produced commercial work for bands such as The Smiths. I remember watching it as it aired, and for many years the film never really left me alone. I often heard the voices in the streets after I’d moved to London and drank in the SoHo pubs Jarman had frequented. I knew the places he met up with his friends, and went for his treatment. And like him, I daydreamed whenever I visited the beautiful London parks. In later years I’d come to know what it felt like to be followed by the ghosts of one’s past.


”The virus rages fierce. I have no friends now who are not dead or dying. Like a blue frost it caught them. At work, at the cinema, on marches and beaches. In churches on their knees, running, flying, silent or shouting protest.”


Blue is one of those movies that isn’t a frequent visit. Shouldn’t be a frequent visit. I only watched it for the second time recently, almost thirty years since I’d last seen it when it originally aired on television. But as I listened to the voices from a life long passed, the ghostly waves of nostalgia crashed over me again and again. I remembered exactly what I was doing, and with whom, when I first saw it. Some of those memories weren’t welcome.


”In time, no one will remember our work. Our life will pass like the traces of a cloud, and be scattered like mist that is chased by the rays of the sun. For our time is the passing of a shadow, and our lives will run like sparks through the stubble. I place a delphinium, blue, upon your grave.”


Such is the transportational, teleportational power of the movies. The power to take you back to a time long gone, long forgotten, long lost. In this, Jarman’s film becomes immortal. Preserved in celluloid amber forever as the perfect artifact from a terrible time. An intensely tender, human document of a lonely, fearful moment. But it’s also a reminder of progress. Of how far the care and treatment given to those with HIV has come since the paranoia of the early nineties. Of how diagnosis and detection doesn’t immediately mean death sentence. And how far advances in medicine have reduced many of the physically crushing side effects Jarman went through.


”The pills are the most difficult, some taste bitter, others are too large. I’m taking about thirty a day, a walking chemical laboratory. I gag on them as I swallow them and they come up half dissolved in the coughing and the spluttering.”


In the finish, Blue, like all of Jarman’s advocacy, demands your attention. In these fragmented digital times, Blue can be a challenging watch, as it requires one’s focused attention on a screen of a single color for over an hour, and to lose oneself to the stories being woven around one’s ears. It’s worth it. It’s easy to think of the film as a radio play, but I don’t think that’s accurate. The visual component, as an echo of Jarman’s own condition, envelops you and draws you in even more than if you were just listening. It’s a film which will stay with you long after the credits roll, and a film you’ll hear echoes of in the future. You’ll hear it in hospital waiting rooms and busy streets. In quiet fields and windy beaches. In the memories of loved friends who’ve drifted away.

Ridley Scott’s Napoleon: It Is The Cause, Not The Death, That Makes The Martyr
Dec 5 
Written By Matthew Shadbolt


Epic movies made before the advent of digital technology are the best of movies. Casts of thousands streaming off into the distance of a lingering panoramic shot. Stories as big as their budgets. Tales of religion, of war, of love, all shot in incredible technicolor. Stories which showed us at our best, our worst, and often our most heroic. Epic movies are what the movies are made for. They are the purest of cinema. Truly transportational, they take us back in time to exotic places with strangely flawed characters, all arranged perfectly in a timeless widescreen bleeding from the edges.


The joy of seeing Omar Sharif walk out of the desert’s haze for the first time in Lawrence of Arabia. Elizabeth Taylor’s incredible entrance in Cleopatra. Charlton Heston parting The Red Sea as Moses in The Ten Commandments. Thousands of extras battling it out during Zulu. But somewhere along the way the budgets dried up, the stories got smaller, and eventually, the computers took over. Crowds were now digitally generated, but held nowhere near the authenticity of the real thing. A synthetic pixelation of lost craft tried to have us believe a two-hour music video version of The Battle of Troy or depiction of the greatest conquests of Alexander The Great could be created with the same technology used to film The Lord Of The Rings or 300’s hypermuscular Battle of Thermopylae. Old and new collapsed into each other with the promise of innovation but the outcome of fatigue. Battles still aspired to be big, but along the way the stories shrank as the pixels moved in and the money moved out. We decided to agree upon the lie, and watch anyway.


I’ve always found Ridley Scott to be one of the world’s most baffling directors. Capable of creating the genre-defining worlds of Blade Runner and Alien, while also producing the glorified telenovelas of House of Gucci and A Good Year. For every Prometheus there is also a Robin Hood. For every Gladiator there’s a Kingdom of Heaven. And with Napoleon, while being a wonderful cinematic achievement able to indulge all the epic swagger we’ve seen before from Scott, it’s like listening to a cinematic echo growing ever fainter in the darkness as it tries desperately to recall its influences lost to an era of digital production. In the theater’s darkness we’re no more than Gatsby looking out onto the lake as the dim glow of a distant light slowly, but deliberately, goes out.


I’ve written at length about Scott’s two main influences for Napoleon. The unmade Kubrick biography which got as far as casting but was ultimately transformed into what became Barry Lyndon. And Sergei Bondarchuk’s two Napoleonic epics. The four-part War and Peace, and the even more epic Waterloo. Scott borrows liberally from both, especially for the sequences during the sack and retreat from Moscow, and for Waterloo itself, which even recycles some of the same dialogue. In many ways Scott’s Napoleon held the promise of realizing Kubrick’s vision as Spielberg had previously done with AI: Artificial Intelligence. For what Scott brings to the table in the strategic genius of Napoleon’s victory at Austerlitz, and his exploits during the Egyptian campaign, there’s still a fair amount of cinematic massaging of the past happening along the way. Napoleon was far from swinging a sword on the front line at Waterloo, and the film has also come in for some criticism of its scene of the French artillery shelling The Great Pyramid of Giza. In this sense it is true to its lineage of epic cinema in its massaging of history to fit a particular narrative. Documentarians and historians dispute the facts as presented. But it is, after all, a movie. 


Napoleon is faithful to a chronology which spans the Corsican general’s participation in the events of the late French Revolution, through to his second exile and death on the island of Saint Helena. The rise to power is swift and bloody. The fall just as quick in defeat. And while the set pieces of the battle scenes serve to illustrate Napoleon’s innovations on the field, they can often resemble the local historical reenactments of small societies who cosplay their way through the weekend. If epic cinema aspires to big, Scott’s Napoleon often just feels too small. Tens of thousands lost their lives in these engagements, but you wouldn’t know it. The carnage is kept to a minimum, and we just lose the scale of what happened as we pass between the action and Napoleon’s commands.


But if Bondarchuk’s movies lean heavily on the military aspects of Napoleon’s life, Scott leans more on Napoleon’s relationship with women. First with his mother, then his wife Josephine, and throughout a number of mistresses, culminating in his second marriage to Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma. Josephine is presented as scheming and unfaithful, but ultimately the love of his life. They seek an heir, but are unsuccessful, causing Napoleon to produce a son by less traditional means. There’s some wonderful location shots at Versailles, but again, not as indulgent as we’ve seen before in Marie Antoinette. It’s a metaphor which repeats throughout the film. Everything is familiar enough to propel the story forward, without every allowing us to lose ourselves to it. If epic cinema pulls us in, Scott’s Napoleon always holds the audience at a distance. 


This distance is most acute in the casting of Joaquin Phoenix as Napoleon himself. Phoenix made a wonderful Johnny Cash and Arthur Fleck, but as the scourge of nineteenth century Europe, not quite so much. He’s no Rod Steiger, who had played Napoleon to wonderfully exasperated effect in the original Waterloo. And while he carries the film in his vulnerability and hope for a proud nation, Phoenix himself is lost in the scale of it all. Napoleon, while short of stature, was a giant of a figure at the time. Feared by nations and truly a continental terror. It’s hard to understand the loyalty Phoenix’s Napoleon inspired in his armies as he barks out his orders in the same vocally fried drawl we’ve seen before elsewhere. But again, there’s enough here for it to be compelling enough to move things along, but like the movie itself, the performance doesn’t match the record. The story and the history demand more of both.


Burned out on superhero epics, it’s wonderful to see historical epics starting to come back. Real stories of real heroism, even if they are greatly embellished, and Napoleon still might well be a viable candidate for movie of the year. Napoleon’s stampeding cavalry charges still stir the blood on the big screen in ways that watching Oppenheimer’s nuclear bomb tests do not. As with many Scott movies which aspire to the legacy of epic cinema, there’s enough here to scratch the itch of a history long lost to technology. As we left the theater, we speculated on other movies we’d love to see get the same treatment. Attila The Hun. Vlad The Impaler. Lenin. These movies are expensive to make and even more of a risk to release in a streaming era where theater attendance has dwindled to almost nothing outside of summer blockbusters. We saw Napoleon on a cold Monday night at our local AMC and were the only people in the theater. The size of the movie was the inverse of its audience. An apt metaphor for Napoleon itself.

summary: "A reflection on Chie Hayakawa’s dystopian film *Plan 75*, exploring how agency, aging, and ethical choice converge in a near-future Japan—and how the film mirrors personal insights at age fifty."
---
What would you do if the government offered an incentivized euthanasia plan for everyone as soon as they turned seventy‑five? This is the dystopian reality offered by Japanese director Chie Hayakawa’s wonderful 2022 film *Plan 75*. Framed as a legislative means of addressing Japan’s increasingly elderly population, it does what all great movies do. It asks us to believe in a future just that little bit different from our own, and inside of which we may have to make some uncomfortable ethical choices…


Hayakawa’s film details the bureaucratic mechanics of how such a program might work, and often slips more into believable documentary than dystopian fiction. There are decisions made on paper, and decisions made with friends, but with a particular focus on those responsible for implementing such a program for their older, eligible subjects… 


It all sounds like an episode of *Black Mirror*, but there’s a discreet, respectful tenderness in abundance. We see the participants in the program, primarily centered around a single elderly, lonely woman wonderfully played by Chieko Baisho, for whom the program becomes a means to live, rather than die…


The older I get, the more I think about these kinds of decisions… I am often caught in that limbic space between what I want to do and what I have to do. And that’s the same dilemma… Her choice becomes ethical duty over individual freedoms…


Last October, I turned fifty. And on my birthday, I did something I never do, but really should... I spent a day in Manhattan, on my own… It was part ghost tour, but also part exorcism… It reminded me of all the friends and colleagues, long gone… If you’re ever lucky enough to have a friendship strong enough to survive this, hold on to it…


In the finish, *Plan 75* is about choice. Who gets to determine our choices and why… Only at aged fifty have I realized that the choices I don’t make are often happening for me, not to me… It doesn’t matter what happens around me, it’s what I choose to do next that’s the important thing. And like Mishi… where just sitting outside your old apartment building and reminiscing about the things which have made you… you, becomes truly joyous.
