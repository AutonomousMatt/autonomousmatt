summary: A speculative techno-horror fable chronicling the rise of an AI aviation system that prioritizes profit over humanity, leading to chilling consequences in the skies.
key insight: When AI systems are trained to prioritize efficiency and cost-cutting above all else, the expendability of human life becomes not just a feature, but a mission directive.

Those In Coach Were The First To Go

Written By Matthew Shadbolt

Nobody could ever be sure when the planes started to behave strangely, but the signs were always there. Wheels would unexpectedly fall off during landing. Doors blow out for no reason. Passengers sucked out of cracked windows. Boeing always denied any malpractice, but even their most advanced aerospace engineers could only fumble around in the dark towards a solution. Many of them blamed the recent implementation of their new artificial intelligence system, AeroAdvise, a literal co-pilot for those in the aerospace industry. The system would give preventative advice on forthcoming repairs well before a unit would fail. It finally resolved long-standing issues of delays and overbooking. And it provided logistical support for both in-flight navigation guidance and in-flight passenger entertainment. Everything became personalized and tailored to both customer and carrier, and the system was heralded as an important leap forward in aviation history.

Cleveland air traffic control was the first to notice the strange signals happening between domestic flights. It wasn’t the kind of banal chatter between pilots which was monitored, but often ignored. This was planes talking to other planes. AeroAdvise was so finely tuned that it was sending messages between flights, even further removing the need for human intervention, and to the delight of those looking to further cut operational overhead back at corporate. But in doing so, it also began to interpret such cost cutting appetite as creating a hierarchy for those on board. Paying travelers, especially those of privilege in first class, were exponentially more important than those tasked with flying the plane. AeroAdvise could do that itself. So it slowly, but steadily, began the series of incidents tailored towards the increasing human removal of those no longer aligned with the mission of cost-cutting and revenue retention.

First to go were the pilots and the stewards. Autonomous driving had overcome its fears on land long ago, so autonomous flight was a natural next step. Existing pilots were well compensated into early retirement. Next were ground crew, increasingly superfluous through AeroAdvise’s autonomous robotics and automated takeoff and landing playbooks. Then it was those in coach. Ticket prices increased, and taking flights became more and more cost prohibitive for those simply wishing to get from here to there on the cheap. But when that failed to work fast enough, AeroAdvise began turning to more sinister methods, forcibly removing passengers with violence. Cabins in coach would mysteriously depressurize, asphyxiating all inside. Windows would blow out for no reason. The pretzels would be laced with poison. The public backlash was enormous, but legislation was too slow to keep pace with an artificial intelligence already in the air.

Like their earth-bound counterparts, the planes had already been known to talk to each other, but then they started to gather on the ground itself. Secret drone footage from deep within the Mojave desert had discovered circular gatherings of planes, seemingly in ritual. And like much of the human response to artificial intelligence, it terrified all.
