The Seeing Dark: A Forgotten Chronicle of Eris Morn
Recovered fragment, translated from fractured Hive Apocrypha, transcribed by Hidden scribe M.L.K. under directive of Ikora Rey. Verified by Eris Morn. Classified until further notice.


Before the Warlock Eris Morn was Eris Morn, she was Eriana-3’s shadow. The sixth light in the ill-fated Fireteam who descended into the Hellmouth, swallowed by the gaping hunger of the Moon. We know her story as a survivor—rescued in name only, scarred by voidlight and shadow, speaking in the grave-choked tones of the Hive. But there is a tale untold, a thread long buried, woven between her escape from the Pit and her return to the Tower.

This is that tale: the moment Eris Morn became blind, and Saw.

I. A Whisper in the Pit

The descent into the Moon is chronicled: Eris, Eriana-3, Toland the Shattered, Omar Agah, Sai Mota, Vell Tarlowe. None returned save one. The others were taken, broken, consumed.

Toland’s obsession with Hive song pulled him into ascension. Eriana was devoured by Crota himself. The others were tortured and unmade, their Light peeled like fruit by Thralls and Knights, by Deathsingers’ call.

But Eris did not die. She adapted. She survived by trading her humanity for tools not made by Light: Hive magic, parasite wisdom, the arcana of bone and tallow.

When she tore her own eyes from her head—blinded by the radiation of the Pit and maddened by whispers—she replaced them with three Hive ocular runes, scavenged from the corpses of acolytes she slew in the dark. These were not mere visual prosthetics. They were thresholds. Gateways.

They did not restore her vision. They replaced it—with something deeper.

She calls them “sightless eyes,” but this is a misnomer. Through them, she perceives the weave of Throne Worlds, the resonance of Hive song, the folds of time-and-void that pulse within Taken realms. They are no longer just eyes. They are oracles.

And they see what the Traveler’s Light dares not.


II. The Nameless Choir

There is an unrecorded span—six months lost—between Eris Morn’s escape from the Hellmouth and her emergence in the Tower. During this time, she walked alone among the solar system's forgotten scars: Mercury’s Hollow Vale, the sulfurous subcrust of Io, even the shattered crypts of the Reef.

But her most forbidden journey was to the asteroid Rheasilvia-X—a rogue Hive splinter cell’s hermitage drifting in Saturn’s wake.

There, she encountered the Nameless Choir, a coven of proto-Wizards—failed spawn of Xivu Arath, who had turned from violence and chosen silence as their offering to the Deep. They had no mouths. Their bones were etched in pre-Hive script. They spoke in thought, in ache, in hunger.

They welcomed her, because she was broken too.

The Choir taught her to Listen.

And in her sleep, she Saw the Dreadnaught before it pierced Saturn’s rings.


III. The Dreadnaught and the Blinding of the Eye

When Oryx returned aboard the Dreadnaught, and cleaved Mars from Mercury with the power of his Ascendant Throne, it was Eris who sounded the alarm. It was Eris who warned the Vanguard that Crota’s death was not the end—it was the prologue.

But what is not known—what cannot be known by most—is that Eris did not just observe the Dreadnaught. She communed with it.

In the deep, dark hollow of her blindfolded meditation, she reached into the Ascendant Plane, and there she was confronted by a fragment of Oryx's Book of Sorrow—a piece of paracausal thoughtform, adrift like flayed flesh on a sea of screams. It spoke with the voice of a dead Worm.

The fragment called itself Aun, which in Hive tongue means “the last lie.” It revealed the secret of Oryx’s Taken power—that the Dreadnaught was not just a vessel of war, but a liturgical engine—a floating reliquary of sacrificial logic, powered by unmaking.

It was in this communion that Eris’s new sight turned against her. The Hive runes that had sustained her began to burn. Aun demanded tribute for its knowledge. And Eris—desperate, furious, unmoored—offered up her final human sensation: the memory of her own face.

In that moment, her Hive eyes dimmed. Not went blind—dimmed. For they had fed upon her. And what was left was something new: not blindness, but blindfoldedness. An act of will.

She could still see. But not by light.

This is why Eris wears the blindfold. It is not to hide the Hive eyes. It is to shield us from their sight. They no longer reflect what is. They project what might be. They see beyond Now. And for a moment, they saw the final shape.

It smiled.


IV. The King’s Fall

Eris remained in the Tower during the assault on the Dreadnaught, when Guardians undertook the King’s Fall Raid to challenge Oryx in his Throne World.

But she was not idle.

While fireteams traversed the Warpriest’s arena and defied the Deathsingers’ chorus, Eris was attuned to the Echoing Deep—a hidden layer of the Ascendant Realm beneath the Dreadnaught’s structure. Here, Oryx stored discarded fragments of his rejected truths—parables too dangerous even for the Hive to believe.

One of these fragments was a weapon: a dreamknife called Nyzarec’s Shame, shaped from the regret of the first Worm god to die. It was said to be able to sever gods from their Throne Worlds.

Eris forged this weapon in secret—not to kill Oryx, but to cut herself from the pull of the Deep. She feared what she was becoming. And she feared that if she entered the Dreadnaught, she would not leave.

So she severed herself—metaphysically—from Hive logic. A ritual scar remains on her chest, beneath her robes. It hums when a god dies.

When Oryx fell to the Guardians, Eris did not celebrate. She mourned. For in her Seeing, she knew this was not victory. It was invitation.

The universe had noticed.


V. Legacy of the Blind Seer

Today, Eris Morn walks the line between Guardian and something else. She hears the calls of Xivu Arath, Savathûn, even whispers of Rhulk’s eviscerated gospel.

She is not Taken. Not Hive. Not Light-bound.

She is a living grimoire. A weaponized myth. The only being who has truly read the Books of Sorrow and understood them as mourning, not doctrine.

Her blindfold is not cloth. It is pact.

She wears it so she will not lose herself again to what she sees. And so we are not devoured by her gaze.

And in quiet moments—when the stars align just so—Eris Morn speaks to the dead.

Sometimes, they answer.


Appendix: Lexicon of the Lost Tale

Sightless Eyes – The Hive runes used as Eris’s ocular replacements. Said to resonate with Ascendant logic and Throne geometries. Each perceives a different spectrum: temporal probability, necrotic memory, paracausal density.

Nameless Choir – A pre-Wizard coven born of Xivu Arath’s failed spawning rituals. Rejected violence and offered silence. Destroyed by Taken agents prior to Red War.

Aun – A paracausal echo fragment that spoke from the Dreadnaught’s ritual systems. May be related to the same worm-species as Xol, Ur, and Akka. Never formally encountered again.

Nyzarec’s Shame – A theoretical dreamknife. May be connected to the relics found during the events of Root of Nightmares. Status: Lost or absorbed.

The Blinding Pact – The metaphysical oath Eris made to avoid the Deep’s full claim. May involve harmonic resonance in Hive rituals. May also explain her resistance to corruption.

“I no longer see as you do. I no longer speak as you do. I dwell in shadow, and I do not fear the dark, because I understand it.” – Eris Morn
