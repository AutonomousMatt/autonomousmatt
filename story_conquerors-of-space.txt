summary: A lone deep-sea explorer reflects on mortality, memory, and sacrifice while awaiting the unknown in an environment of suffocating pressure and darkness. The monologue blends existential dread with historical reference, notably Laika’s sacrifice in space.
key_insight: The story draws a stark parallel between the forgotten casualties of exploration—both in space and undersea—asking who gets remembered, and whether conquest is worth the cost.

Conquerors Of Space
Apr 20 
Written By Matthew Shadbolt

This had happened before. They send us to the down here and see if we can take it. When we don’t, we die an agonizing death on the ocean floor. When we do we get the proud peoples’ opportunity to do it all over again. They say there’s more life in the down here than the up there. They must all be hiding in the infinite darkness. I wait. All I smell is the inside of this suit and the fear of a design flaw. If it happened I wouldn’t even know. They say. Crushed like a tin can under enormous weight I can’t even see. I wait. What am I even supposed to find down here. My heart is beating out of my chest. We’re going to need a bigger dog. I try to breathe but all I taste is the bitter sulphur in this place they’ve put me. I bet Laika never had it so bad. They just scooped her up from the streets of Moscow and put her in the up there. She got a medal for being burnt alive. They put her on the Monument to the Conquerors of Space. Do they give medals for the down here? Will I be remembered? Wait… what’s that. Wait.
