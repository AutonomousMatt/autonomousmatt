The Boy With The Dip
Mar 28 
Written By Matthew Shadbolt

The boy with the dip killed the shark with the spear. Something the boy would always be known for, and for which the shark would have headlines the next day.

Uncoffined, the shark now served only to glorify the boy and to be served for dinner for thousands of gulls excited to be here. Despite their lives so violently intertwining on the beach, neither shark nor boy would ever amount to anything as exciting again. Over time the shark’s bones would be cleared away by the morbidity of treasure hunters and the news gathering of tomorrow’s fish and chip paper.

The boy with the dip always remembered he killed the shark with the spear. But such bravery couldn’t get a job and didn’t pay the mortgage. The past does not pay the bills of the present. His teeth now rotted out of his head, he still wonders who died on the beach.
